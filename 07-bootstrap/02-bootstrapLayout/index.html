<!-- 

One of the most powerful features of bootstrap is the 12 column layout system.

This layout system is made of three components, first we need a div with the class of container.

Inside of that container, we need another div, which is going to have the class row. It is inside of this row where we will have our items with the class of col, and they will be laid out using the column system.

Basically, we have a container which has a row, inside of that row we add the columns that we want. For example lets say that for the first row we want a nav, we might want a column for the logo and a column for the nav.

If we add a hero section, we add another row with just one column.

When we have multiple columns inside of these rows, bootstrap will try to give every column equal spacing and space them across the entire width of the container.

So, as in the example, the first row will have 6 columns with one fr and the second row will have three columns with 1/3 of the space. 

The bootstrap container is responsive
