Web hosting is the process of making the websites available on the internet.

To do that, we need to put all of the files and data that the website consists of (index.html, images, etc) onto a web server.
Right now, all of these files are only available locally on our machine.

She creates a new repo on github with a readme file and just drop the CONTENT OF THE portfolio folder. So not the folder, but all the files and directories that the project contain.

Github looks for index.html as the root (maybe because it only hosts static websites).

After dropping the files and commit the changes, we navigate to settings and pages (left menu).
From there, we change the branch (under build and deployment) from none to main, which contains our root folder.

This process can take a while, but after that we get a url to where the webpage is live.

Again, this is only for static websites.
